This project forms the Python "backend" to the following mbed project:
http://mbed.org/users/mblokzijl/programs/TMP102_Serial_Logger/lrqmmi

This allows you to publish the current temperature readings to a Google Docs spreadsheet, which can be used for live data visualisation. 

You'll need the following:
- Access to Google Docs
- an mbed + TMP102 temperature sensor (though I'm sure you can make this work with the microprocessor of your choice as well (Arduino e.g.))

Here's an example of what the results can look like: http://playground.m01.eu/live-temperature

The livelogger.py script will also save local logfiles (e.g. temp_DD.MM.YYYY.log). The plotter.gnuplot script can be used to visualise these using gnuplot (http://www.gnuplot.info)

Quick Start guide:
1. Create a google spreadsheet. Call column A 'Time', and column B 'Temperature' (just insert those into the first row). You can optionally add a third column called 'Comment' or similar, which can be used by some visualisations such as the timeline.
2. Use the spreadsheetFinder.py script to get the spreadsheet key and the worksheet id of your new spreadsheet.
3. Insert the values you got into the livelogger.py's configuration section.
4. Make sure that the serial port search string can be used to find the serial port to which your microcontroller is connected. Consult your microcontroller's documentation for details (http://mbed.org/handbook/SerialPC for mbed)
5. Upload the code from http://mbed.org/users/mblokzijl/programs/TMP102_Serial_Logger/lrqmmi to your mbed, and hook up your TMP102 temperature sensor. Make sure your mbed is connected to your computer.
6. Run the livelogger.py script and watch your spreadsheet!

You can now add a graph to your spreadsheet and publish that, or embed a "gadget" onto your website, or just keep the data to yourself.
